    <h1 class="background dis">Why I Chose This Project</h1>
    <p>In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, people are becoming more health-conscious, but many face challenges when it comes to accessing gym services ‚Äî like long-term commitments, limited flexibility, and complicated booking systems. I identified a need for a solution that not only connects users to nearby gyms but also gives them full control over their fitness journey.

That‚Äôs why I created FitHub ‚Äî a platform designed to offer:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Flexible weekly payments instead of monthly fees, allowing users to try different gyms without being locked into long-term commitments.</li>

<li>Easy slot booking with a smooth and user-friendly interface.</li>

<li>Location-based search so users can find gyms near them instantly.</li>

<li>A wide range of gym categories like men‚Äôs gym, women‚Äôs gym, yoga, indoor, and outdoor gyms.</li>

<li>Coach and facility details available for both online and offline gym experiences.</li>

</ul><br>

<p>This project solves a real-world problem and offers a unique approach to fitness booking, making gym access more flexible and user-friendly.</p></p>
    
    <h1 class="challeneges dis">Project Challenges</h1>
    <p>
        Designing a smooth and simple experience for users was a major focus. I faced challenges in:
<ul>
<li>Creating an easy slot booking flow without confusion.</li>

<li>Organizing multiple gym categories clearly on all screen sizes.</li>

<li>Making the UI beginner-friendly for users unfamiliar with tech.</li>

<li>Ensuring mobile responsiveness and consistent design across pages.</li>

<li>Handling location permission prompts in a user-friendly way.</li>

These challenges helped me build a clean, intuitive, and flexible fitness booking experience.
        </p></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="process dis">The Process- Design Thinking</h1>
    <p>Understanding user needs and emotions is the first step before initiating the design process, as illustrated in the image below.</p>

    <h1 class="process dis">Problem statements</h1>
    <p>Many fitness enthusiasts struggle to find nearby gyms that suit their needs due to limited online discovery tools and lack of location-based filtering. Traditional gym platforms often require monthly subscriptions, offering little flexibility for users who want to explore options before committing. Additionally, booking gym slots is either unavailable or overly complicated on most platforms. There's also a noticeable gap in providing clear coach details and service transparency. Lastly, many existing systems are not optimized for mobile devices or real-time location access, making the overall experience less user-friendly.

I learned how to simplify complex booking flows, create flexible payment models, and prioritize responsive design for mobile users. Conducting user research and testing helped me improve usability and validate design decisions. This project strengthened my skills in UI/UX thinking, design iteration, and building accessible, user-first digital experiences.
